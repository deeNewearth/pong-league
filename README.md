# current status
I was unable to pay full attention to the coding challenge. I had reserved yesterday for the Task, but while running a short errand to the nearby "city" My car broke down, and since we are in a small town and there are not many "hailing ride" options. I was back super late at my place.Anyway I tried my best in the few hours I could manage. I got the graphQL backend and Front end working to some extent.
It is available for you guys to take a look. If it's OK will create a branch and Put in few more hours of work to get it to the point where I like it.
